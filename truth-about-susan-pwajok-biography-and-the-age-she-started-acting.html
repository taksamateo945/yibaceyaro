As a child actress and now a young adult, Susan has starred in many Nigerian movies and TV shows and not just some regulars but the likes of critically acclaimed Desperate Housewives Africa and The Johnson TV series, some of the best works the industry has ever produced.</p><p>Still, Susan is only but a young girl, and in the years to come, there is no doubt that she will delight her fans and movie watchers in general with her delectable acting talent. A look at the actress’s biography tells how much of a huge talent she is.</p><h3><strong>Summary of </strong><strong>Susan Pwajok’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name</strong>: Susan Laraba Ganchung Pwajok</li><li><strong>Date of birth</strong>: January 15, 2003</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 20 years old</li><li><strong>Place of birth</strong>: Lagos State, Nigeria</li><li><strong>State of origin</strong>: Plateau State, Nigeria</li><li><strong>Nationality</strong>: Nigerian</li><li><strong>Education</strong>: Greenwood private school, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi.</li><li><strong>Occupation</strong>: Modeling and acting</li><li><strong>Years active</strong>: 2012 to date</li><li><strong>Best known for</strong>: Blessing in the Johnsons</li><li><strong>Net worth</strong>: $50, 000 (estimated)</li><li><strong>Marital status</strong>: Single</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Susan Pwajok and Where Was She Born?</strong></h2><p>Susan Pwajok is 20 years old and comes from the Berom tribe in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. The Berom/Birom people are the largest autochthonous ethnic group in Plateau State, with their ancestral home in Jos North, Jos South, Barkin Ladi (Gwol), and Riyom local government areas in Jos. Some Beroms are found in some parts of Southern Kaduna, where they also call their home.</p><p>The predominant religion of the people is Christianity and Traditional African religion, while their indigenous language is called Berom. As of Nigeria’s last census data, Susan Pwajok and her family members are part of the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>1 million Beroms</a> which significantly adds to Nigeria’s 201 million population (2019 estimates).</p><p>Though a Berom by tribe, Susan belongs to the crop of millennials born in cities very far away from their parent’s ancestral land. She was born in Nigeria’s commercial capital, Lagos State, and was raised in the state’s opulent Ikoyi Island.</p><p>There is no available information yet about her parents or even her siblings. But from what we can infer, seeing how young (3 years old) she was when she started acting, there are plausible reasons to believe that Susan’s parents have been hugely supportive of their daughter’s acting career from the go. She has in the past made a post on Twitter about her parents.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy Father’s Day to my beautiful mama❤️🥰 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QF0bazvJ1d</a></p><p>— Susan pwajok (@pwajok_susan) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">June 21, 2020</a></p><h2><strong>She Made Her Acting Debut At the Age of 3</strong></h2><p>She landed her first acting role in a stage play titled Adaobi is Getting Married as a 3-year-old but had to put her acting career on hold for the next 6 years that followed. During this time, Susan attended Greenwood private school, Parkview Estate, Ikoyi.</p><p>As she got older, she was getting ready to return to her childhood passion – acting. Still, when an opportunity came to model as a child, she (or her parents on her behalf) grabbed it with both hands as she modeled for Kf Faces, Ikeja.</p><p>In 2014, Susan Pwajo starred in her very first notable Nigerian movie titled The Tunnel. For a then 11-year-old, it was a loud cheer for her acting career seeing her in the same movie with the likes of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Waje Iruobe</a> as Sade, Femi Jacobs as Pastor Lade Olagbesan, Patrick Doyle, Nse Ikpe Etim, Femi Akeredolu, and Lepacious Bose. Stanlee Ohikhuare directed the film, while the trio – Adejumoke Atunde, Grace Edwin-Okon, and Morenike Erinle were the producers.</p><h2><strong>At 20, Susan Pwajok is an Actress, Brand Ambassador, and Social Media Influencer</strong></h2><p>Egged on by the success of her first official Nollywood film and seeing the caliber of actors and actresses who stand out as some of Nollywood’s best heads she starred with, Susan Pwajok pressed on her acting career. In addition, she has also diversified her income sources to include non-acting sources.</p><h3><strong>Susan’s Movies and TV Show</strong></h3><p>Still 2014, she auditioned for a role on Tinsel but was instead chosen to act in an African Magic Original Film. She thereafter landed roles in films like –</p><ul><li>Keeping Lucy</li><li>Night Raid</li><li>Coverup</li><li>Stopping Chloe</li><li>Steer Wheel</li><li>Steel Bling</li><li>The Johnsons</li><li>Desperate Housewives Africa</li></ul><p>With these acting credits, the young talented actress had already begun drawing significant attention as to how good she is at what she does. In 2017, she won the Movie Personality of the Year Award of a Nigeria Child and was nominated for AMVCA Best Actress in a Comedy Series.</p><h3><strong>She has Brand Endorsement Deals with Notable Companies</strong></h3><p>Susan Pwajok is one of the few Nollywood thespians whose acting career has been able to catch international attention. Though not yet as an actress, but as a brand ambassador. She is currently a brand ambassador for Hewlett-Packard, a software company famous for the HP line of computers. Susan has also been featured in an official Samsung Galaxy S20 FE advert alongside musician Koredo Bello and Esther Uzodinma.</p><p>In addition to these two, she promotes and models for Payporte on her Instagram account and the weight loss products from @PharmacistElla, perfumesandbeyond, @Liptoniceandtea, @Cardburyhotchocolateng, @bimfemnaturalhairproduct, etc.</p><p><strong>Summary of brands and products Susan Pwajok promotes</strong></p><ul><li>HP</li><li>Lipton</li><li>Payporte</li><li>Samsung</li><li>Pharmacist Ella</li><li>Cadbury Nigeria</li><li>Perfumes and Beyond</li><li>Bimfem Natural Hair Product</li></ul><h3><strong>Susan’s Social Media Following&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Like many Nigerian celebrities today and celebrities worldwide, Susan has leveraged her successful acting career to draw in a steadily growing social media following. She is notably on Instagram as susanpwajok, where she promotes most of the brands she is affiliated with and gives us a glimpse of what goes on in her personal life.</p><p>She also has an eponymous <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>YouTube channel</a>, which she created in 2015. On the channel, she posts prank videos, promotes brands she is signed with and does random videos with her friends.</p><h2><strong>The Johnsons Remain </strong><strong>Her </strong><strong>Most Significant Acting Role to Date</strong></h2><p>Though it is given that Susan Pwajok has acted in a good number of films, it can’t be argued that her starring in The Johnsons stands out as one of her best works. In the television series, she plays the character of Blessing, the youngest child in the family, and has a way of getting what she wants.</p><p>At the same time, she doesn’t like her other siblings <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Samuel Ajibola</a> (Spiff), <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Chinedu Ikedieze</a> (Efe Johnson), Seun Adebajo Osigbesan (Jennifer Johnson), and Olumide Oworu (Tari Johnson) to get attention from their parents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK5706usraBdlq%2BwwdNmqq6rkaN6scPAo6akZZKevKi%2BwKmfsmWRo7FuwMeeZJqflWLAqbGMrKuaqqSasW6twq2gp59f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftruth-about-susan-pwajok-biography-and-the-age-she-started-acting.html&text=Susan%20Pwajok%20Biography%20and%20The%20Age%20She%20Started%20Acting&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftruth-about-susan-pwajok-biography-and-the-age-she-started-acting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftruth-about-susan-pwajok-biography-and-the-age-she-started-acting.html&title=Susan%20Pwajok%20Biography%20and%20The%20Age%20She%20Started%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftruth-about-susan-pwajok-biography-and-the-age-she-started-acting.html&title=Susan%20Pwajok%20Biography%20and%20The%20Age%20She%20Started%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftruth-about-susan-pwajok-biography-and-the-age-she-started-acting.html&title=Susan%20Pwajok%20Biography%20and%20The%20Age%20She%20Started%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftruth-about-susan-pwajok-biography-and-the-age-she-started-acting.html&description=Susan%20Pwajok%20Biography%20and%20The%20Age%20She%20Started%20Acting" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-black-eyed-peas-get-reflective-on-constant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Black Eyed Peas get reflective on 'Constant'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./christian-eriksen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christian Eriksen- Age, Net Worth, Height, Wife, Career, Nationality">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
