However, Mamelodi Sundowns proved to be the giant of football in the country by winning the league and being the first team to win the PSL title in four consecutive seasons. That season is over, and sixteen clubs, including the defending champions, are already slugging it out in this season’s competition.</p><p>PSL 2021/2022 season began on 14 August 2021. Fixtures have been announced as regards how the 16 teams will face each other in the season until a winner emerges and the season comes to an end on 21 May 2022. This article looks at how the 16 PSL clubs started and who their owners are. So keep reading as we walk you through the list of PSL clubs in the 2021/2022 football season and their owners.</p><h2><strong>All The 16 Premier Soccer League (PSL) Teams For The 2021/2022 Season And Some Facts About Them</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>: Patrice Motsepe</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $11 Million</li><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 1970</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong>: Lucas Masterpieces Moripe Stadium, Loftus Versfeld Stadium</li><li><strong>Major Trophies</strong>: PSL: 11 | CAF Championship League: 1 | CAF Super Cup: 1 | MTN 8: 3 | Telkom: 4 | Nedbank: 4</li><li><strong>Domestic Titles</strong>: 14</li><li><strong>International Titles</strong>: 2</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Mamelodi-Sundowns.png><p>Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club is currently the defending champions in the Premier Soccer League 2021/2022 season, after ending the 2020/2021 PSL season at the top of the log. This Tshwane-based club is one of the most prominent South African professional football clubs. They have made a name for themselves as being both national and international champions. This club was initially formed in early 1960 by a group of friends, including Reginald Hartze, Joey Lawrence, and Bernard Hartze. However, it was only in 1970 that it became an official football club named ‘Sundowns.’</p><p>By 1973, the club got affiliated with the Federation Professional Football League, and five years later, they were relegated. Sundowns tried to gain promotion to the top flight a couple of years later, and at some point, the club was almost disbanded. They would later relocate the club base to Mamelodi in Pretoria in the ’80s.&nbsp;Zola Mahobe took over the club ownership in 1985, and he appointed Ben Segale as head coach. Under new ownership, Sundowns experienced better management which showed off in their field performance.</p><p>Zola Mahobe went all out to recruit renowned football stars. Unfortunately, in 1988, Standard bank repossessed the club from Mahobe, which went into liquidation. To save the club, Angelo and Natasha Tsichlas, formed a company called Abe Krok and took over 100% ownership of the club.&nbsp;Under this new ownership, Sundowns won the first NSL League Trophy and then went on to win three consecutive titles from 1998 to 2000.</p><p>In 2001, the club became the only South African club to make it to CAF Champions League. In 2004, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Patrice Motsepe</a>, a renowned South African businessman, bought 51% shares in the club, and later, he took up total ownership. Under his ownership, Sundowns have been appropriately managed and has won trophies like the Nedbank Cup and the CAF Super Cup. The club is currently managed by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Steve Komphela</a>, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Manqoba Mngqithi</a>, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Rhulani Mokwena</a>.</p><h3><strong>2. Supersport United F.C.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>: SuperSport</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $8.6 Million</li><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 1994</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong>: Lucas Moripe Stadium, Atteridgeville Pretoria</li><li><strong>Major Trophies</strong>: PSL: 3 | Nedbank Cup: 5 | Telkom Knock out: 1 | MTN 8: 3</li><li><strong>Domestic Titles</strong>: 6</li><li><strong>International Titles</strong>: Nil</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Supersports-FC.png><p>This is not just one of the best in South Africa, but it also has one of the best youth football academies in the country. Supersport United FC was initially known as a Pretoria City franchise. Still, after it was purchased by M-Net in 1994 and got approval from the National Soccer League, the name was changed.&nbsp;Supersport United FC is an association football club owned by the South African Group of Television channels, ‘SuperSport.’</p><p>The club is affiliated with Premier Soccer League (PSL) and other youth academy teams. After playing for 25 seasons in the PSL, Supersport United has won the league three times. In recent years, they seem to have taken a comfortable position around the 5th to 7th place on PSL. In the 2020/2021 season, they came 5th. Currently, the club is managed by Kaitano Tembo.</p><h3><strong>3. </strong><strong>Kaizer Chiefs F.C.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>: Kaizer Motaung</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $11 Million</li><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 1970</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong>: FNB Stadium</li><li><strong>Major Trophies</strong>: Nedbank Cup: 13 | MTN 8: 15 | Telkom Knockout: 13 | PSL: 4</li><li><strong>Domestic Titles</strong>: ±6</li><li><strong>International Titles</strong>: 3</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Kaizer-Chiefs.png><p>Kaizer Chiefs is a South African-based club also known as Amakhosi. The club was founded in 1970 by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Kaizer “Chincha Guluva” Motaung</a>, a legendary footballer who returned from the United States after playing for Atlanta Chiefs. The name ‘Kaizer Chiefs’ was gotten from his first name and the last name of his former club. 2000/2001 season has remained their most successful, and unfortunately, the most tragic season for Kaizer Chiefs since their history. They won four trophies that season, including Coca-Cola Cup, Vodacom Challenge, African Cup Winners’ Cup, and the BP Top Eight.</p><p>Sadly, their season celebration was cut short when disaster struck at Ellis Park Stadium as 43 fans lost their lives during the 2001 Soweto derby clash against Orlando Pirates. The achievement of Kaiser Chiefs in the 2001/2002 season got recognition in 2002 and saw them nominated for the CAF Club of the Year award by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). In the 2003/2004 season, they won the PSL for the first time in their history.</p><p>Under the leadership of Ted Dumitru and Collins Mbesuma, they made history by scoring 39 goals in the 2004/2005 season. Kaizer Motaung and his <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>family</a> are still active in running the club, which has now grown into a family business.</p><h3><strong>4. Amazulu F.C.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>: Sandile Zungu</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $9.3 Million</li><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 1932</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong>: Kings Park Stadium</li><li><strong>Major Trophies</strong>: Telkom Knockout: 1 | National Professional Soccer League: 1</li><li><strong>Domestic Titles</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>International Titles</strong>: Nil</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Amazulu-FC.png><p>Amazulu F.C. is also one of the oldest clubs in South Africa. It was founded in 1932 by&nbsp; Zulu migrant workers. The club was initially known as Zulu Royal Conquerors, but after it was introduced to the then-Zulu King, King Solomon, it was changed to Zulu Royals. In 1968, the team was supposed to escort the coffin of the late King Bhekizulu but had a match to play against SAPPI Homestars, and unfortunately, they lost. After losing the game, an argument broke out between supporters who criticized their decision to play a match on the funeral date.</p><p>Due to the argument, the club was moved from eMbelebeleni to eWema by Mr. Gideon Sibiya and Mr. Ntuli. By the end of 1970, the remaining committee members, Mr. Mkhize and Mr. Ralph Mabaso, went in to rebuild the club and registered it under Zulu Royals United, and took the team back to eMbelebeleni Royal Kraa.&nbsp;In 1973, the club experienced another setback when the then-manager, Mr. Bethwell Masondo, left the club and took some of their good players. The following year, the club was taken over by supporters, and the name was changed to Amazulu Football club.</p><p>By 2002, Mr. Sisa Bikisha bought the club, and in 2005, Dr. Patrick Sokhela took over the club’s ownership and bought the Premier Soccer League status of Dynamo FC to help the team get back to prominence.&nbsp;His effort to bring the team to the top-flight failed as the team got relegated and had to buy Thanda Royal Zulu’s Premier Soccer League Status to rejoin the league in the 2016/2017 season. After so many setbacks, Sandile Zungu purchased the club in 2020. The new ownership drafted a 12-year plan to see the club become one of the most renowned South African clubs.</p><h3><strong>5. Orlando Pirates F.C.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>: Irvin Khoza</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $14 Million</li><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 1937</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong>: Orlando Stadium</li><li><strong>Major Trophies</strong>: PSL: 4 | Nedbank Cup: 8 | Telkom Knockout: 1 | MTN 8: 10 | CAF Champions League: 1| CAF Super Cup: 1</li><li><strong>Domestic Titles</strong>: 9</li><li><strong>International Titles</strong>: 3</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/orlando-pirates.png><p>Orlando Pirates FC is also one of the biggest, most renowned, and oldest clubs in South Africa, founded in 1937. The Buccaneers, as they are called by fans, were founded by offsprings of migrant workers who moved to rural areas to work in gold mines. As of 1940, the first president of the club, Bethuel Mokgosinyane, purchased football kits for the boys with his own money.</p><p>From the inception of Orlando Pirates, they have always been known for winning their matches. In 1971, 1973, 1975, and 1976 they won the National Professional Soccer League title, and they have won the Premier Soccer League four times. In the 2020/2021 PSL season, they came third.&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Irvin Khoza</a> currently serves as chairman and owner of Orlando Pirates. Under his watch, the club has grown a fan base of over 10 million and has won numerous trophies, including the MTN 8, Telkom Knockout, and PSL.</p><h3><strong>6. </strong><strong>Stellenbosch F.C.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>: Stellenbosch Academy of Sport in Stellenbosch</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 2016</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong>: Coetzenburg Stadium, Stellenbosch</li><li><strong>Major Trophie</strong>s: Nil</li><li><strong>Domestic Titles</strong>: Nil</li><li><strong>International Titles</strong>: Nil</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/stellenbosch-fc.jpg><p>Stellenbosch Football Club is one of the newest professional football clubs in the South African PSL. It was founded in 2016 when PSL Executive Committee approved the application of the National First Division side, Vasco Da Gama, to change their name after the club relocated from Parrow to Stellenbosch.&nbsp;On 1 December 2016, it was confirmed that Steve Barker would join Sammy Troughton to coach the team.</p><p>Despite having two coaches, they were unable to gain promotion to the ABSA Premiership (as the PSL was known then), resulting in the club parting ways with Sammy Troughton. In 2018, the club was purchased by Stellenbosch Academy of Sport, and under the new management, they were able to confirm promotion to the then-ABSA Premiership a season later. On 25 October 2020, the Cape Winelands club played their first-ever PSL game against Moroka Swallows F.C. Since its formation in 2016, Stellenbosch FC has not earned a title or won a trophy.</p><h3><strong>7. Baroka F.C.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>: Khurishi Mphahlele (Chairman)</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 2007</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong>: Old Peter Mokaba Stadium</li><li><strong>Major Trophies</strong>: Telkom Knockout, National First Division, Vodacom League</li><li><strong>Domestic Titles</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>International Titles</strong>: Nil</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/baroka-fc.png><p>Baroka FC has been in existence since 2007 but rose to prominence in 2011 when they made it to the semi-final of the Nedbank Cup after defeating prominent PSL club sides like Kaizer Chiefs and Moroka Swallows.&nbsp;The club won the 2010/2011 Vodacom League Limpopo division, but unfortunately, they did not meet the required points to get promoted to the National First Division. Matsimela Thoka currently serves as the club’s coach, and Khurishi Mphahlele is the chairman. Since the club’s inception in 2007, they have won trophies from 2018 Telkom Knockout, 2015–16 National First Division, and Vodacom League 2010–11.</p><h3><strong>8. Maritzburg United F.C.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>: Farook Kadodia (Chairman)</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 1979</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong>: Harry Gwala Stadium PMB</li><li><strong>Major Trophies</strong>: Nil</li><li><strong>Domestic Titles</strong>: Nil</li><li><strong>International Titles</strong>: Nil</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/maritzburg-united-fc.jpg><p>Maritzburg United FC is a South African football club in Pietermaritzburg. It is also one of the oldest clubs in the PSL, as it was founded in 1979. Despite playing in the PSL for more than ten seasons, they have never won the PSL championship. Their best try was in the 2017/2018 season when they got to the 4th position. In the 2020/2021 PSL season, they came 13th. Considering the number of years this club has been in existence, it is normal to expect more from them.</p><p>The board of directors of the club comprises five executives, of which Farook Kadodia serves in the capacity of chairman. We can’t say for sure whether the inability of the club to win more trophies is managerial or the fault of players. Despite not having any trophy to their name, they have earned two honors, including First Division Coastal Stream champions: 2007/08 and First Division Championship Play-offs: 2008.</p><h3><strong>9. Cape Town City F.C.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>: John Comitis</li><li><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $8.7 Million</li><li><strong>Year Founded</strong>: 1960s</li><li><strong>Stadium</strong>: Cape Town Stadium</li><li><strong>Major Trophies</strong>: MTN 8 | Telkom Knockout</li><li><strong>Domestic Titles</strong>: Nil</li><li><strong>International Titles</strong>: Nil</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Cape-town-city-fc-.jpg><p>The origin of Cape Town City FC can be traced back to 1962. However, the club saw a reformation when John Comitis purchased the franchise rights of defunct Mpumalanga Black Aces FC in 2016. The Black Aces were based in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. Still, on buying it, John Comitis moved the franchise to Cape Town because he believed that Cape Town was deserving of a good football powerhouse that could represent the city’s diverse footballing heritage and talent.</p><p>Since moving to Cape Town, the team has produced notable players like Thabo Mngomeni, Bernard Hartze, and Reggie Jantjies. They have also become a football powerhouse in Cape Town and have a couple of titles – the Telkom Knockout Cup in 2016 and MTN 8 in 2018. The team’s manifesto is to represent all ethnic groups in <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Cape Town</a>. It seeks to define Cape Town’s rich football history, and so far, we can agree that they are making efforts to achieve it. They currently play their home matches at Cape Town Stadium, but John Comitis has <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>announced plans</a> to build their stadium.</p><h3><strong>10.

The club was created in 1947 and has been in existence for over seven decades. They currently play in the DStv Premiership.&nbsp;It was founded by three football lovers in Johnny Kubheka, Ishmael Lesolang, and Strike Makgatha, who initially called it Congregated Rovers. On 10 October 1947, the founders changed the club’s name, and this time to ‘Moroka Swallows,’ which has remained the club’s name to date.</p><p>The ’50s and ’60s proved to be successful decades for the club, and their most significant achievement during this time was winning the South African League title in 1965. Aside from the successes they experienced in the field, the club also experienced business success. In 1971, it became the first club to be registered as a public business. That same year, they became the first club to receive sponsorship when they got associated with Teljoy.</p><p>After finishing 15th place in the 2019/2020 season and failing to retain their league status, the club became relegated for the first time since 1947, when it was founded. At the start of the 2018/2019 session, the club purchased the franchise of the National First Division team, Maccabi, for R8 million, and at the end of the 2019/2020 session, they gained promotion to Premier Soccer League.</p><h3><strong>11.

The club was formed in 2010 after Chippa Mpengesi purchased the Vodacom League franchise of Mbekweni Cosmos for R400,000.&nbsp;Their first footballing season – the 2010/2011 season – was a successful one as they won the Western Cape Vodacom League and went on to win the Vodacom League National Coastal Stream. This earned them a promotion to the National First Division.
