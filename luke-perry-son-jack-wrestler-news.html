Some take their lives in a very different direction. Take <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>Luke Perry</strong></a>'s son,<strong> Jack Perry</strong>. While <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Luke was known for</a> entertaining audiences on screen, Jack is entertaining fans in another way altogether. Jack is a professional wrestler who goes by the name Jungle Boy, and he recently made waves for revealing his relationship with another wrestler, <strong>Anna Jay</strong>.</p><p>As <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>reported by People</a>, there were already rumors swirling that Jack and Jay were dating after some flirty comments were exchanged on her Instagram account last month. Now, there's no doubt that they're together. On June 28, Jack posted a photo of himself and Jay kissing in front of a stadium, which Jay reposted to her own Instagram Story. Read on to learn more about Jack, his career, and his now very public personal life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Jack-Perry-2019.jpg><p>Jack started wrestling in matches independently after high school, and in 2019, he signed with All Elite Wrestling, which he is still with today. In a 2019 interview with Sports Illustrated, Jack explained that an announcer gave him <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>the nickname Jungle Boy</a> when he was using the alias Nate Coy.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"At first, I hated it," Jack said. "I thought, 'What did he just stick me with?' Then I started to develop the character around the name, and I love it now. It's completely my own. Eventually, I dropped the Nate Coy, and now I am Jungle Boy." In character as Jungle Boy, Jack keeps his long hair loose and wears leopard print shorts.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>See The Rock's 19-Year-Old Daughter, Who's Climbing Up the WWE Ranks</a>.</strong></p><p>Jay is also signed with All Elite Wrestling and is a member of the group The Dark Order. However, she's currently taking some time off from wrestling after suffering a shoulder injury earlier this year. She and Jack haven't shared much about their relationship yet other than the photo he posted and some <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>kissy-face emoji in the comments section</a> of a previous post. Their wrestling friends are definitely exciting about the pairing, though. Jack's post was met with plenty of "finally!" messages and one that reads, "There we goooooooo."</p><p><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><p>In an Instagram post following Luke's death in March 2019, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Jack wrote</a>, "He was a lot of things to a lot of people. To me, he was always Dad. He loved and supported me in everything, and inspired me to be the best that I could possibly be." He added, "I'll do whatever I can to carry on your legacy and make you proud."</p><p>In the Sports Illustrated interview, Jack shared that he doesn't want to find success through who his father was. "My family is a part of who I am, but I'm trying to make my own way," he explained. "I don't want to use that to be successful, I want to have my own success."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/luke-perry-1.jpg><p>Before Jack was signed to a big wrestling organization, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Luke was spotted</a> at one of his son's early matches in 2017. In a video from the event, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Luke can be seen</a> on the bleachers with the rest of the small crowd, filming the match on his phone. At one point he stands up, nervously watching the fight.</p><p>Jack is 24 years old and has a 21-year-old sister named<strong> Sophie Perry</strong>. Their mother is<strong> Rachel Sharp</strong>, who was married to Luke from 1993 to 2003.</p><p>The siblings are close. Earlier this month, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Sophie posted a photo</a> of her brother holding a dog on Instagram and wished him a happy birthday. "Happy birthday to the&nbsp;#1 Christmas Eve dog groomer on the block!" she wrote. "I love you so much Pookie!"</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>How Old 100 Iconic Stars Would Be If They Were Alive Today</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqxsdGrsGarn6N6q63CpGSwqpWowa2x0Walnq%2BjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fluke-perry-son-jack-wrestler-news.html&text=See%20Luke%20Perry%27s%20Pro%20Wrestler%20Son%2c%20Who%27s%20the%20Talk%20of%20the%20Sport%20Right%20Now&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fluke-perry-son-jack-wrestler-news.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fluke-perry-son-jack-wrestler-news.html&title=See%20Luke%20Perry%27s%20Pro%20Wrestler%20Son%2c%20Who%27s%20the%20Talk%20of%20the%20Sport%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fluke-perry-son-jack-wrestler-news.html&title=See%20Luke%20Perry%27s%20Pro%20Wrestler%20Son%2c%20Who%27s%20the%20Talk%20of%20the%20Sport%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fluke-perry-son-jack-wrestler-news.html&title=See%20Luke%20Perry%27s%20Pro%20Wrestler%20Son%2c%20Who%27s%20the%20Talk%20of%20the%20Sport%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fluke-perry-son-jack-wrestler-news.html&description=See%20Luke%20Perry%27s%20Pro%20Wrestler%20Son%2c%20Who%27s%20the%20Talk%20of%20the%20Sport%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alice-de-bortoli.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alice De Bortoli">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10082415-cal-ripken-jr-was-kinda-pissed-at-alex-rodriguez-for-move-to-shortstop-in-2001-asg.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cal Ripken Jr. 'Was Kinda Pissed' at Alex Rodriguez for Move to Shortstop in 2001 ASG | News, Scores">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
