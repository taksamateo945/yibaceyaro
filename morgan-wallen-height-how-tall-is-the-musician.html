Another area in which the country singer stands heads and shoulders above his colleagues is his career achievements. Since dropping his debut EP, Stand Alone, in 2015, Wallen has risen to become one of the biggest superstars in country music. He has released multiple platinum albums and his music has been streamed about four billion times.</p><p>He has also headlined several sold-out tours and in February 2021, his second album, Dangerous, became the first country album to top the Billboard 200 for seven weeks. Wallen has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top but this was nearly <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>derailed</a> when he was filmed using racial slurs in February 2021. This caused several radio stations to drop his music but he is bouncing back again.</p><h4><strong>Summary of Morgan Wallen’s Body Measurements</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Morgan Cole Wallen</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> Morgan</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 13th of May 1993</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Age: </strong>30</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign: </strong>Taurus</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> straight</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 10 ½ inches</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 179 cm</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Weight:</strong> 150 lbs (68 kg)</li><li><strong>Biceps size:</strong> 15 inches (38 cm)</li><li><strong>Chest size:</strong> 50 inches (127 cm)</li><li><strong>Waist size:</strong> 32 inches (81 cm)</li><li><strong>Hip size:</strong> 31 inches (78 cm)</li><li><strong>Morgan Wallen’s hair color:</strong> auburn</li><li><strong>Eye color:</strong> brown</li><li><strong>Tattoos:</strong> none</li></ul><h2><strong>How Tall is Morgan Wallen?</strong></h2><p>Morgan Wallen is 5 feet 10 ½ inches (179 cm) tall. The singer is taller than the average guy out there and this is confirmed by statistics. Data from the Center for Disease Control in 2018 shows that the average American male aged 20 and above is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>5 feet 9 inches</a> (1.75m) tall while the average American woman aged 20 and above is 5 feet 4 inches (1.62m). It, therefore, means that Morgan Wallen is one and a half-inch taller than the average American man out there and six and a half-inch taller than his average female compatriots.</p><p>When it comes to Hollywood, the situation is not much different. The average Hollywood male celebrity is <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>5 feet 10 inches</a> (1.77 m) tall while the average female Hollywood celebrity is 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 m) tall. It, therefore, means that Morgan Wallen is half an inch taller than the average Hollywood male star and five and a half-inch taller than most female stars.</p><h3><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Height Compared to Luke Combs’ Height</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/03/Morgan-Wallen.jpg><p>Morgan Wallen has collaborated with many of his fellow country music stars and one of them is Luke Combs. He supported Combs on the latter’s Beer Never Broke My Heart Tour of 2019. In turn, Combs gifted him a precious piece of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>music history</a> in the form of a rare and expensive guitar. We can definitely expect more collaborations from these two in the future. While we wait for that to happen, Luke Combs is 5 feet 8 inches (1.73m) tall which means that Morgan Wallen is two and a half-inch taller than him.</p><h3><strong>How Tall is Morgan Wallen Compared to HARDY?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/03/Morgan-Wallen-1.jpg><p>Another long-time collaborator of Morgan Wallen’s is HARDY. The two worked together on the 2019 hit song, He Went To Jared. HARDY has also penned several songs for Morgan Wallen and joined Wallen on stage during the NYC leg of his Dangerous Tour in February 2022. The two gave an exhilarating performance that blew the minds of fans. Their height would have been of little importance then but if anybody bothered to check they would discover that Morgan Wallen is two and a half-inch taller than HARDY who is 5 feet 8 inches (1.73m) tall.</p><h3><strong>Riley Green is Taller Than Morgan Wallen</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/03/Morgan-Wallen-2.jpg><p>One of the few country music stars that can boast of being taller than Morgan Wallen is Riley Green. Before finding fame as a singer, Riley Green variously played college football and contested on reality TV. He dropped his first EP in 2013 but it took about five years before he even scored a recording contract. The perseverance has paid off as he now has several hit singles to his name. In 2019, he won best new male artist at the Academy of Country Music Awards. Riley Green is 6 feet 4 inches or 1.93m tall. This makes him five and a half-inch taller than Morgan Wallen.</p><h2><strong>Morgan Wallen’s Weight and Workout Routine</strong></h2><p>Morgan Wallen’s weight is put at 68 kg or 150 lbs. His other body measurements are biceps size – 15 inches, chest size, 50 inches, waist size – 32 inches, and hip size – 31 inches. He has a lean and muscular physique and there is no doubt that this has played a part in the trove of female admirers that he has. Morgan Wallen has no tattoos but he does spot a distinctive mullet hairstyle. He has revealed that the reason he got the same was that his dad once spotted it.</p><p>The country singer has yet to explicitly dish on his workout regimen and diet plan but a look at his Instagram page will show that he maintains an active and healthy lifestyle. Wallen has shared <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>videos</a> of himself playing golf. He has also shared pictures of his workouts with the founder of the Grit N Hustle, a company that provides personal training, gym services, security services, and nutrition advice.</p><p>Wallen has also posted videos of himself taking wellness juice shots.
