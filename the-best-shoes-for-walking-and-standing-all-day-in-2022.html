So when you’re shopping for nine-to-five footwear, it’s key to look for style and&nbsp;function. Whether you prefer to rock flats or sneakers, clogs or slip-ons, we found the best shoes for walking and standing all day that you don’t want to overlook on your search.</p><h2>What to look for in a good walking and standing shoe</h2><p>Board-certified podiatrist Patrick McEneaney, DPM, has three criteria he asks every patient to follow when shopping for shoes. First is fit. “You want to make sure that the shoe fits adequately. It should be wide enough in the front, but not too wide in the back,” says Dr. McEneaney. If the back of your footwear isn’t snug enough, it will cause your feet to rub and may result in blisters. And conversely, if the shoes is too narrow, it will squeeze your toes and cause joint pain. You’re looking for the goldilocks shoe that fits just right.</p><p>Support is also important, says Dr. McEneaney. Rather than going for a shoe that’s the foamy, squishy equivalent of wearing clouds on your feet, he recommends picking up something foamy, yet firm. “[Squishy] shoes feel comfy initially, but they may lead to chronic overuse problems or can actually accentuate preexisting problems,” says Dr. McEneaney. So when you’re shopping, think: “I want clouds, but, like, Hollywood-style clouds that I can actually stand on.”</p><p>Lastly, Dr. McEneaney recommends picking something up that has a stiff midsole. “So when you look at the bottom of the shoe, the middle one-third should be stiff and difficult to bend. The more that it bends, the more it’s going to load pressure from the back of the foot to the front of the foot. If the shoe has some more stiffness, it’s gonna load the pressure through the shoe, and take some of that stress off the middle of the foot,” says Dr. McEneaney. You don’t want foot stress on top of work stress… that’s for sure.</p><p><span class="inline pr-6 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><p>Now that you’re equipped with the intel you need, you’re ready for The Great American Pastime. (I’m talking about shoe shopping. Not baseball.) Below, we round up our best shoes for walking and standing all day</p><h2>The 4 Best Shoes for Walking for Women</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fitflop-1.png><p>FitFlop Multi-Rally E01 Knit Sneakers — $110.00</p><p>This breathable pair of sneakers is perfect for summer—they’re crafted using a light and soft engineered knit fabric, and you can pull ’em on (the laces are optional, even though they’re there) for ease. The best part is that they’re made with FitFlop’s all-day cushioning Anatomicush™ midsoles, which makes them ideal for walking (and standing!). Plus, they come in five different colors (including “Cream” and “Soft Lilac”). All of FitFlop’s footwear has the official Seal of Approval from American Podiatric Medical Association, so the brand is always a safe (and stylish) bet for a comfortable shoe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/S50202-1_1.jpeg><p>Saucony Women’s Omni Walker 3 Wide — $100.00</p><p>I mean, they’re literally called The Walker. And that’s because this ’90s-style all-white sneaker is smartly designed for all-day comfort and stability. These shoes feature a lightweight feel, and durable upper and outsole.

While I wouldn’t necessarily try to push my power-walking pace in flats, they’re the perfect mix of comfort and cuteness that you crave as you walk among gray office cubicles. Bonus: The material is made of recycled plastic bottles, they require no break-in time whatsoever, and they’re machine-washable! Just FYI: These do notoriously run small, so make sure to size up a half-size.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bw1_desktop_cc9effe0-fe51-46cb-b370-4c0f3b8c1524_1200x1500.png><p>Clove Women’s Brilliant White Clove Shoe — $103.00</p><p>Clove shoes are designed specifically for nurses—and they don’t disappoint.

Although they’re technically running shoes, they’re built to withstand the harshness of roads and concrete with their cushioning and supportive design. In terms of comfort, the Ghost 14 is best in class: with an open-engineered air mesh upper and 3D fit print tech, these sneaks give you the stretch, softness, and structure your feet need.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1113513-WEPR_1.jpeg><p>Hoka One One Women’s Bondi X — $200.00</p><p>As one five-star reviewer writes, “I’m a nurse and at times I work 16 hours a day. I decided to try Bondi X and I’m so glad I did. If feels like I’m walking on clouds for my whole shift. I usually have to switch out shoes during a 12-hour shift of being on my feet, but with these shoes, my feet don’t hurt at all after 16 hours on my feet.” Enough said. We’ve written at length about the<span> magic of Hoka</span>, especially why they<span>make such a good walking shoe. </span>Our senior commerce editor even swears by them for her <span>three-mile dog daily dog walks</span>.</p><p>Hoka’s generally run a little bit large, so bear that in mind when you order your pair.</p><h2>The 3 Best Shoes for Standing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/techloompro-black-heathergrey-white-1_1200x.jpeg><p>APL Women’s TechLoom Pro — $160.00</p><p>Designed for running, the APL Women’s TechLoom is a dream for standing around all day. The shoe is super supportive, but the foam keeps a low-profile that offers a cool, more luxe look. Other features include: Fabric that’s woven into a single layer for breathability and ultra-stretching, a midsole and outsole that is designed to protect the foot when it makes contact with hard ground, Propelium®, which gives you more bounce and gives the midsole more structural integrity (and thus stretching out the lifespan of the shoe), all vegan materials, and 8mm drop from the heel that puts your foot and arches in a more natural position when you’re walking, running, or standing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/0000940_professional-cordovan-cabrio_600.jpeg><p>Dansko Professional Cordovan Cabrio — $130.00</p><p>My aunt works full-time as a nurse and she’s been wearing these for years. They’re a favorite to many medical profession—and that says a lot. What makes them so beloved by those on their feet for long hours is their unique design that prioritizes and maximizes longterm comfort. The roomy toe box keeps toes from getting squished or bruised, the PU midsole gives supreme support, and the protective heel counter lets your heel go up and down while still keeping feet stable. Plus, the clog features an anti-fatigue rocker bottom that helps with forward motion, so you kind of feel like you’re being propelled as you go (it’s really cool).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/TB1WHBK080_SHOE_ANGLE_GLOBAL_WOMENS_TREE_BREEZERS_HEATHERED_BLACK_BLACK_db208e21-9b53-47df-a496-08125d544475.jpeg><p>Allbirds Women’s Tree Breezers — $98.00</p><p>If you’re more of a flats person, this cozy pair of Allbirds is calling your name.

Every step rocks your forward and delivers you where you need to go next. While it’s definitely on the more cushion-y side, you’ll find that the extra plushness isn’t squishy—rather, it lifts your feet and gives them a nice bounce that makes walking all day much more bearable. Featuring a super grippy Vibram® outsole and debris-resistant mesh upper (this makes it great for outdoor walking, especially when it’s on trails and dirt, hence the name), you’ll be all set with comfort and protection. And bonus: The colorways are excellent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ef0bc867-5493-4f41-a295-dd21dd94db09.jpeg><p>Vionic Willa Slip-On Flat — $130.00</p><p>This sleek slip-on has undercover support that’s well-equipped to help those with plantar fasciitis.
