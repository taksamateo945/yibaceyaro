It certainly seems like almost everyone is deathly afraid of something, and often something you might not expect.</p><p>According to The Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 19 million adults in the U.S. (8.7 percent of the population) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suffer from a specific phobia</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Specific phobias</a> can often be traced back to an explicit source or experience. It is a fear that is brought on by a particular event or trauma and it usually develops in childhood.</p><p>Some of these types of fears arise from the invention of new technologies: artificial intelligence, chemicals, and even cell phones. There are also more complex phobias that are a product of conditioning or life experience, genetics, and brain chemistry. And some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">strange phobias</a> may also be remnants of early human behavior from a time when our ancestors lived in a more tense and threatening world.</p><p>Whatever their genesis, the important thing to remember about weird phobias is that various therapies can help people take control of these fears. That's why professionals encourage sufferers to seek help for their phobias, no matter how strange they may seem. Besides, it's virtually certain that someone somewhere probably has an even weirder phobia than yours.</p><p>See for yourself in the gallery of weird phobias above.</p><p>Next, discover more of the world's <a href=#>strangest phobias</a>.
